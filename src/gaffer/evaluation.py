"""The standing evaluation harness: how good is the model, on what yardstick.

Three things live here that nothing else in the codebase had. First, metrics
*stratified by what actually happened* — a single MAE is dominated by the
players who scored nothing, which every model gets right, so it flatters
everything equally and can never tell two models apart where it matters.
Second, calibration-first scoring of the probability heads: a p60 that is
right on average and wrong in every bin is worse than useless to a MILP that
multiplies by it. Third, one persistent artifact (``reports/evaluation.json``)
so a number from three weeks ago is still there to regress against.

Everything expensive is imported inside the function that needs it: the web
layer imports this module just to read the artifact and must not pay for
LightGBM to do it.
